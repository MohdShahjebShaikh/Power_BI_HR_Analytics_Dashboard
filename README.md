# Power_BI_HR_Analytics_Dashboard

Hello Everyone,

I am excited to introduce my first Power BI project: The "HR Analytics Dashboard" The primary goal of this project is to support organizations in enhancing employee performance, improving retention rates, and reducing attrition by leveraging data-driven insights. This endeavor has been accomplished through the development of an HR analytics dashboard, structured around three key departments: Human Resources, Research and Development, and Sales.

To accurately assess employee performance and retention, I have employed various key performance indicators (KPIs), including overall employee count, attrition figures, attrition rate, average employee age, benchmarking average salaries, and the average duration of an employee's tenure with the company.

餃쩚잺 Here's a breakdown of the project process:

游릭 Data Extraction: We received the data from the client in Excel format.
游릭 Data Transformation: The data was imported into Power BI and underwent cleaning, including the removal of null values and duplicates, rectification of spelling errors, and data type standardization using Power Query.
游릭 Data Loading: The transformed data was loaded into Power View for further analysis.
游릭 Data Modeling: We created a logical structure for the data during the data modeling phase, facilitating effective analysis and visualization.
游릭 Writing DAX: The data was refined further using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated measures and columns for advanced analysis.
游릭 Report Building: We crafted intuitive and user-friendly reports and visualizations to construct the dashboard.

餃쩚잺 Insights:

游릴 The highest attrition rate is observed in the Life Sciences Education department i.e. 38%, and Laboratory Technicians as job role i.e. 62.
游릴 Out of a total of 237 employees who left the company, 150 were male, and 81 were female.
游릴 The age group most affected by attrition is 26-35.
游릴 Attrition is directly related to job satisfaction, with different job roles showing varying levels of attrition. Lower job satisfaction correlates with a higher likelihood of attrition.
游릴 Interestingly, despite an average salary of 6.5K, employees earning below this threshold have a higher risk of attrition.
